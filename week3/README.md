## 📚 What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **DOM Manipulation** – Creating, updating, and deleting elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- **CSS Styling & Animation** – Designing responsive, modern UIs using gradients, transitions, and hover/fade effects.
- **Dark Mode Toggling** – Using CSS variables and JavaScript to implement seamless theme switching.
- **Filtering Logic** – Creating real-time task filters using array methods and dataset attributes.
- **State Management** – Maintaining an array of task objects and updating the DOM accordingly.
- **UI/UX Thinking** – Making the app not just functional but also beautiful, colorful, and fun to use!

This project also reinforced best practices in writing clean, readable, and modular code, and it gave me a better understanding of how to structure a small-scale front-end application.
